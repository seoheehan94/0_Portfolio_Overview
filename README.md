## 1. Memorability of scene line drawings
This research examines why certain images are more memorable than others. I applied computational modelling and experimental methods to analyze how shape-based contour features influence memorability. Even without colour or texture, line drawings retained memorability patterns similar to photographs. Using Random Forest models, I identified key predictors, such as T-junctions, and demonstrated their causal role through targeted image manipulations.

## 2. Orientation Tuning in humans
This study investigates how humans perceive orientation in complex images by comparing texture-based and contour-based computational methods. Through behavioural experiments and statistical modelling, I show that people rely more on shapes and edges than textures when judging orientation. Using neural data and an image-computable model, I demonstrate that contour-based orientation computations better align with human brain activity. These findings challenge filter-based models, highlighting the importance of edge-based processing in vision science.
